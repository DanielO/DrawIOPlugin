Draw.IO plugin for FosWiki
====
This plugin allows you to embed Draw.IO SVGs (which have the Draw.IO document embedded in them) in a topic and allow the user to edit them by double clicking on the image.
It is unlikely to work on anything but a modern browser.

## To Do
* Add some options for image display (size, offset, etc).
* Tidy up - JS especially.
* Handle PNG with XML embedded files.

## Thanks
* Stack Overflow.
* Foswiki IRC channel.
